## 3. Why I built this :hammer:
The primary objective of this project was to acquire the skills necessary to create a fully responsive layout. It marked my initial endeavour in designing a layout that seamlessly adapts to various mobile devices. This project was completed through a guided coding experience provided by(https://www.scrimba.com/)

## 4. what I learned building this project.
- How to create fully responsive website by using **Media Queries** and Flexbox.
- How to use **Media Queries** to to change the design  of a webpage based on different screen size and devices type.


## 5. Challenges :sweat:
During the process of building this project, I didn't encounter any major setbacks. However, I did face a few challenges and learned valuable lessons:

1. **Adopting Mobile-First Design:** Initially, embracing the mobile-first design approach posed a challenge. However, I quickly adapted to it. This methodology, starting with the smallest screen sizes and progressively enhancing the design for larger devices, is a great way to ensure responsiveness.

2. **Understanding `Max-width` and `Min-width` Properties:** I had some difficulty grasping the concept of how the `max-width` and `min-width` properties function within media queries.

   - `Max-width`: This property ensures that an element's width does not exceed the specified value. It essentially allows the element to have a width ranging from zero up to the specified value but not exceeding it. example:

   ```css
   @media screen and (max-width: 619px) {
     .main {
       width: 90%;
       margin: 0 auto; /* for screens not larger than 619px, apply these style rules */
     }
   }
   ```

   - `Min-width`: This property specifies that an element will not have a width smaller than the specified value but can expand beyond it. It ensures that the element does not shrink beyond a certain point, which is the specified width. example:

   ```css
   @media screen and (min-width: 619px) {
     .main {
       width: 90%;
       margin: 0 auto; /* for screens larger than 619px, apply these style rules */
     }
   }
   ```
